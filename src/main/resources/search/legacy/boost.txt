#uri-term mapping; terms are indexed as SearchBoost field for the document with the given uri and sub-uris.
#When a search containing mapped terms are performed , the document corresponding to these search terms will be boosted to be shown as priority results.

#Separate search terms with commas(,)

#Use following example formats for mapping

#1. To map all documents starting with a uri ( including the base uri ), use the following
# /economy/grossdomesticproductgdp/bulletins/* => gross, domestic, product

#2. To map a single uri to search terms
# /economy/grossdomesticproductgdp/bulletins/grossdomesticproductpreliminaryestimate/2015-10-27 => preliminary, estimates


########### NOTES ###########
# Spaces at the beginning or end of the `uri` are ignored and do not affect the matching
# Spaces in and around the terms is ignored does not affect the setting of the search boost fields
# Check the root [base] of the content path; if the content path has a 'master' root directory include this in the CONTENT_DIR env variable i.e. CONTENT_DIR=c:\temp\content\master
#           essentially the URI are matched to the folder structure under $CONTENT_PATH therefore $CONTENT_PATH/<URI> must be valid
